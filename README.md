# myApps
Apps that I made while studying at the university.

First two projects made in Qt.

The first project - Huffman code - is an application that implements Huffman and Fano-Shannon coding algorithms using binary search tree. You can code your texts and decode them. The app allows you to read data from file and then write results into another file. Also you have the opportunity to check coding tree in a new window.

Second project - Strategy game. In this app were implemented such design patterns as abstract factory, snapshot, composite, observer. Also, template classes are used to create two different sets of game rules that the user can choose. All the basic principles of object-oriented programming are fully disclosed in this project.

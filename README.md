# My Apps
Apps that I made while studying at the university.

Online-debates - my bachelor's work. It is a web service for organizing online-debates using WebRTC and Socket.io. 

CRUD training - simple Spring Boot application with H2 SQL database and Hibernate. It has all CRUD operations and some additional features to manage tables. 

myApps:

First two projects made in Qt.

The first project - Huffman code - is an application that implements Huffman and Fano-Shannon coding algorithms using binary search tree. You can code your texts and decode them. The app allows you to read data from file and then write results into another file. Also you have the opportunity to check coding tree in a new window.

Second project - Strategy game. In this app were implemented such design patterns as abstract factory, snapshot, composite, observer. Also, template classes are used to create two different sets of game rules that the user can choose. All the basic principles of object-oriented programming are fully disclosed in this project. 

Third project - voice_analisys on python. In this program using the resemblyzer library you can determine the number of speakers in the audio recording(mp3, wav, ogg), indicating the time stamps of their speech and check if the same person is speaking on two different audio recordings.
